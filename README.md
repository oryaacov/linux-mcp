**Linux-MCP**
================

A Node.js (TypeScript) project that creates an MCP (Master Control Program) server, allowing you to remotely manage and execute commands on Linux machines.

**Overview**

Linux-MCP is designed to provide a centralized management platform for controlling and automating Linux-based systems. The AI-driven architecture enables the execution of various commands, scripts, and 
tasks on target machines, giving you full control over the system.

**Features**

* Remotely access and manage multiple Linux machines from a single interface
* Execute shell commands, scripts, and tasks on target machines
* Supports various Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)
* AI-driven automation for repetitive or complex tasks
* Real-time monitoring and logging of system activities

**Technical Requirements**

* Node.js (TypeScript) 14+
* TypeScript compiler (optional, but recommended for type safety)

**Getting Started**
=====================

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/linux-mcp.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Compile and run the project: `tsc` (compile only) or `node index.ts` (run with TypeScript compiler)
4. Configure the server by editing the `config.json` file (e.g., set IP addresses, ports, and AI settings)

**Usage**

1. Connect to the Linux-MCP server using a supported client (e.g., SSH, telnet)
2. Use the command-line interface or API endpoints to execute commands, scripts, and tasks on target machines
3. Monitor system activities and logs in real-time
